## üìå Project Overview
The project addresses the challenge of **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using machine learning while tackling the issue of **imbalanced datasets**. The focus is on improving the classification accuracy of minority activities through various **data balancing techniques** and **machine learning models**.

Two benchmark datasets are analyzed:
- **PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring**
- **HAR using Smartphones**

The dissertation evaluates the effectiveness of balancing techniques and different classifiers to improve model generalization and reliability in **real-world applications** such as healthcare, sports monitoring, and smart environments.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - NumPy, Pandas (Data Handling)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
  - TensorFlow & Keras (Deep Learning)
  - Imbalanced-learn (Data Balancing)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

## üìä Datasets
### 1. **PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset**
- Contains sensor data from IMUs placed on the **wrist, chest, and ankle**.
- Recorded activities: **Walking, Running, Cycling, Sitting, Standing, etc.**
- **Class imbalance** present with certain activities being underrepresented.

### 2. **HAR using Smartphones Dataset**
- Captures **accelerometer and gyroscope** data from smartphones.
- Labeled activities: **Walking, Standing, Sitting, Lying Down, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs**.
- Imbalance occurs in activity distributions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- **Handling missing values**
- **Feature scaling & selection**
- **Train-test split using stratification**
- **Encoding categorical labels**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Balancing Techniques
- **Oversampling:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- **Undersampling:** Random Undersampling
- **Hybrid Approaches:**
  - **SMOTEENN (SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbors)**
  - **SMOTETomek (SMOTE + Tomek Links)**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest**
- **LightGBM**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, & F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**

## üìà Results
- **Hybrid balancing techniques (SMOTEENN & SMOTETomek) improved model performance** on minority classes.
- **CNNs performed best on sequential sensor data**, capturing temporal dependencies effectively.
- **Random Forest & LightGBM provided high interpretability and robust performance**.
- **SMOTE improved recall for minority classes but sometimes introduced synthetic noise**.

## üî• Key Findings
- Data balancing significantly impacts HAR model performance.
- Hybrid techniques provided better generalization than simple oversampling or undersampling.
- CNNs are effective for time-series sensor data but computationally expensive.
- Feature selection improves model efficiency and interpretability.
